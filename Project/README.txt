Instructions:
This was done using Oculus VR

Hold down the analog stick (press it down) to teleport around. This will let
you move around the scene. Its a fairly large library. 

Press the back grip to pick things up. In this scene, you can pick up and throw
books and candle sticks. You should be able to teleport around with them too.

As a heads up, I played around with the raycasting but the teleportation is kinda
wonky. The targeting reticule sometimes causes collisions, and sometimes bounces back and forth 
between the area and controller. You might find yourself teleporting into the wrong area.
